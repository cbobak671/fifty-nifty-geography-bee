## Game Description

Fifty Nifty United States is a trivia game inspired by game creator Chris's love for nature, maps, and encyclopedias, as well his nostalgia for his childhood when he won his school's geography bee in the 5th grade. Players will test their knowledge of the 50 states as well as the hundreds of U.S. National Parks in this fun, educational game.
